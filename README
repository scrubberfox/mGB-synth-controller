This is a guide to build a controller for mGB (MIDI Gameboy)
The project uses an Arduino Nano but can be used with other versions of arduino

Project requires an already working and built Arduinoboy as this project does NOT send 
MIDI notes to the gameboy, it controls the parameters of each of the channels using 
physical pots and buttons rather than using the DPad or NES controller making it
more like a synth (in my opinion) 

Features control of each channel by selecting using 《 and 》 buttons
Channels include PU1, PU2, WAV, NOISE and OMNI
Project features 8 pots for control over each of the MIDI CC functions
Pitchbend, envelope, Pulse width/shape, Pitch sweep, Pitchbend range,load preset,Pan and Sustain
