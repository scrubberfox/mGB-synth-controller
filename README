This is a guide to build a controller for mGB (MIDI Gameboy)
The project uses an Arduino Nano but can be used with other versions of arduino

Project requires an already working and built Arduinoboy as this project does NOT send 
MIDI notes to the gameboy, it controls the parameters of each of the channels using 
physical pots and buttons rather than using the DPad or NES controller making it
more like a synth (in my opinion) 

Features control of each channel by selecting using 《 and 》 buttons
Channels include PU1, PU2, WAV, NOISE and OMNI
Project features 8 pots for control over each of the MIDI CC functions
Pitchbend, envelope, Pulse width/shape, Pitch sweep, Pitchbend range,load preset,Pan and Sustain

CV control has been added in version 0.2, for this please connect cv input jack (ring, pin 3) to A0 -7 (same as the pots and ensure the
connection isn't connected to ground when no jacks are plugged in or this will stop any CC messages at all) along with the ground pin of each jack (sleeve pin 1) to ground
(I used thonkiconn jacks pin 1 is sleeve, 3 is ring) see jack pinout diagram

You also need to add the library for Arduino from https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface - created by Pieter P
install the zip to your libray before uploading code to Arduino
