List of Materials 

Arduino Nano (or compatible alternative)
5 x 1k resistors
2 x 220 ohm resistors
5 x LEDs 
8 x 10k potentiometers
2 x momentary push buttons

Project requires an already working Arduinoboy and copy of mGB
Also requires the download and installtion of Arduino library https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface by Pieter P

POTENTIOMETERS
The analog pins on the board A0 - A7 go to the middle pin/wiper of each of the 10k potentiometers

Pot A0 - Pitchbend, A1 - Pulsewidth/Shape, A2 - Envelope/Shape, A3 - Pitchsweep, A4 - Pitchbend range
A5 - Load preset, A6 - Pan, A7 - Sustain

The left pin/wiper of each pot connects to the GND pin
The right pin/wiper of each pot connects to the 5v pin

PUSHBUTTONS
The digital pins D2 and D3 connect to one side of the pushbuttons, the other side connects to the GND

LEDs
The digital pins D4 - D8 connect to the (+) side of the LEDs via a 1k resistor for each 
The (-) leg of the LEDs connect to the GND

MIDI
The MIDI outputs connect to the existing MIDI IN on the Arduinoboy (providing you built one with the 5 pin DIN input and not just USB)
5v pin connects to a 220 ohm resistor then to pin 5 of the MIDI in
TX pin connects to a 220 ohm resistor then to pin 4 of the MIDI in
GND pin connects to pin 2 of the MIDI in

POWER
The arduino board can either be powered by connecting the Vin from the same power as the Arduinoboy or via its own USB cable 

EASY TO USE

LEDs 1 - 5 (D4 - D8) display the MIDI channel which are:
Channel 1 - PU1
Channel 2  - PU2
Channel 3 - Wave
Channel 4 - Noise
Channel 5 - OMNI/poly
These channels are selected by pressing the momentary push buttons one is < the other is >

As mentioned previously:

Pot1 - Pitchbend, Pot2 - Pulsewidth/Shape, Pot3 - Envelope/Shape, Pot4 - Pitchsweep, Pot5 - Pitchbend range
Pot6 - Load preset, Pot 7 - Pan, Pot8 - Sustain giving you full control over every function on mGB
